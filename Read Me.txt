Psychiatrist is a very fun to try program.
Its like, you have a Psychiatrist in your 
computer to talk to you. and its really cool
You can either chat with Br. Brian 
(he is the psychiatrist in other words me)
or just try out with a friend and you both can just
chat with the program (which is much more fun !)
